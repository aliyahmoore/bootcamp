# question 3: Weâ€™re letting you know what value (true or false) we want each variable to have, and your job is to add an expression that evaluates to the correct value using comparators.
# test_1 should be false
test_1 = 5 > 10

# test_2 = should be false
test_2 = 1==2

# test_3 = should be true
test_2 = 5==5

# question 4: Booleans: The code below indicates what value (true or false) we want each variable to have, and your job is to add an expression that evaluates to the correct value using boolean operators (&&, ||, or !).
# test_1 should be true
test_1 = true && 5 == 5

# test_2 = should be true
test_2 = 5==5 || 1==2

# test_3 = should be false
test_3 = !(5==5)
